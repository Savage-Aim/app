# savage-aim
A webapp for management of Character and Static BIS information for raiding in FFXIV.

Supports Pandaemonium Asphodelos and will support future tiers.

Will continue updating as we go, I'd like this to be a fully featured website that members of the XIV community are able to use.

There is a [wiki](https://wiki.savageaim.com) available for more detailed help and assistance!
